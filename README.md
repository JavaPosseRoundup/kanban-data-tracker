Kanban Data Tracker
===================

Kanban Data Tracker will make tracking data on a kanban board (and maybe other types of process visualization boards) easy.

The project is currently in the inception phase.  So far, we've built a prototype android application which can read and program NFC tags on a Kanban board.
